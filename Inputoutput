<h1 align="center">Input/Output</h2>
<p>
This is yet another imperative feature of C. Reading values from the user
and printing values to the terminal impart a sequential flavor to the
program. If you print a variable and then do some computation, you get
some output. Instead, if you do the computations first and then print
the same variable, you may get a different output. It is very essential
that you understand the precise flow of execution of a C program. Well,
so far you have encountered only flat sequences of statements executed
one-by-one from top to bottom. Things start getting complicated as you
encounter jump instructions (conditionals, loops and function calls).
For <i>effective computation</i> you need these jump instructions.
Imperative programming may be a complete mess, unless you understand
the control flow thoroughly.

<p>
<a name="stdio"></a>
<h2 align="left">Standard input/output</h2>
<p>
This is the direct method of communicating with the user, namely, reading
from and writing to the terminal. Here are the basic primitives for doing
these.

<h3 align="left">Scanning values</h3>
<p>
The usage procedure for <tt>scanf</tt> is as follows:
<pre>
   scanf(<i>control string</i>, &amp;var1, &amp;var2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
The primitive <tt>scanf</tt> waits for the user to enter a value
by the keyboard. After the user writes a value and hits the enter button,
the value goes to the memory location allocated to the variable specified.
So <tt>scanf</tt> is another way of assigning values to variables.
<p>
The <i>control string</i> specifies the data type that is to be
read from the terminal. Here is a list of the most used formats:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%d</tt><td>Read an integer in decimal.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%o</tt><td>Read an integer in octal.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%x,%X</tt><td>Read an integer in hexadecimal.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%i</tt><td><p>Read an integer in decimal/octal/hex.
If the integer starts with 0x or 0X, treat it as a hexadecimal integer, else
if it starts with 0, treat it as an octal integer, otherwise treat it as
a decimal integer.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%u</tt><td>Read an unsigned integer in decimal.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%hd,%hi,%ho,%hu,%hx,%hX</tt><td>Read a <tt>short</tt> integer.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%ld,%li,%lo,%lu,%lx,%lX</tt><td>Read a <tt>long</tt> integer.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%Ld,%Li,%Lo,%Lu,%Lx,%LX</tt><td><p>Read a <tt>long long</tt> integer.
This is not an ANSI C feature, but works well in Linux. Replacing <tt>L</tt>
by <tt>ll</tt> (i.e., using <tt>%lld</tt>, <tt>%lli</tt>, etc.) continues to
work in Linux and may be better ported to other architectures. Some compilers
also support <tt>%q</tt> (quad).
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%f</tt><td>Read a <tt>float</tt>.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%e</tt><td>Read a <tt>float</tt> in the scientific (exponential) notation.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%lf,%le</tt><td>Read a <tt>double</tt>.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%Lf,%Le</tt><td>Read a <tt>long double</tt>.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%c</tt><td>Read a single character.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%s</tt><td>Read a string of characters.
</table>
</center>
<p>
<b>Example</b>
<pre>
   int a;
   unsigned long b;
   float x, y;
   char c, s[64];

   scanf("%d",&a);   /* Read the integer a in decimal */
   scanf("%x",&b);   /* Read the integer b in hexadecimal */
   scanf("%f",&x);   /* Read the floating point number x in decimal notation */
   scanf("%e",&y);   /* Read the floating point number y in the scientific notation */
   scanf(" %c",&c);  /* Read the character c */
   scanf(" %s",s);   /* Read a string and store in s */
                     /* For reading strings the ampersand (&) is not needed */
</pre>
<p>
Suppose that the user enters the following values:
<pre>
   123 123 -123.456 1.23e-6 a Hey! I am your instructor.
</pre>
<p>
Most of the readings go as expected. <tt>a</tt> receives the decimal value
123, <tt>b</tt> receives 0x123 (which is 291 in decimal), <tt>x</tt> and
<tt>y</tt> respectively receive <tt>-</tt>123.456&nbsp;=&nbsp;<tt>-</tt>1.23456e2 and
1.23e<tt>-</tt>6&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.00000123. Also <tt>c</tt> obtains the value
<tt>'a'</tt> (whose ASCII value is 97).
<p>
However, a problem comes with the string <tt>s</tt>: it
receives the value "Hey!" only. The rest of the input is lost!
The situation is actually worse: the rest is not lost. The computer
remembers this part and supplies this to the next <tt>scanf</tt>,
if any is executed. Why does it occur? The reason is: <tt>scanf</tt>
stops reading as soon as it encounters a white character (space, tab,
new line, etc.). You have to do something more complicated in order to
read strings with spaces. Note also that the scanning of <tt>c</tt>
requires a space before the <tt>%c</tt>. This is for consuming
the space following the value of <tt>y</tt> given by the user. The
same applies to the reading of <tt>s</tt>. Reading characters and strings
is often too painful in C. Here are the basic rules:
<ul>
<p><li><tt>scanf</tt> stops reading as soon as it encounters a white character.
The trailing white character remains in the input stream.
<p><li>Leading white characters are ignored, when numbers are read.
<p><li>White characters are characters and so are not ignored, when
characters and strings are read.
</ul>
<p>
You can read more than one variables in a single <tt>scanf</tt>. The
six <tt>scanf</tt>'s for the last example can be combined as:
<pre>
   scanf("%d %x %f %e %c %s", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;c, s);
</pre>
Spaces are ignored before numbers. So the statement
<pre>
   scanf("%d%x%f%e %c %s", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;c, s);
</pre>
<p>
has the same effect. You may use other separators instead of space.
For example, the following statement
<pre>
   scanf("%d,%x,%f,%e,%c,%s", &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;c, s);
</pre>
<p>
requires you to enter the input values as:
<pre>
   123,123,-123.456,1.23e-6,a,Hey! I am your instructor.
</pre>
<p>
In all these examples, the string <tt>s</tt> is assigned the value
"Hey!". Use the <tt>fgets</tt> primitive (see below) to repair this.
<p>
It is also a queer thing to use <tt>&amp;</tt> in every argument except
strings. This is because <tt>scanf</tt> is a function. In C, every
function call is of the type <i>call-by-value</i>. In order to see
the desired effects (assignments of the arguments by the values given
by the user), we need to pass addresses of the variables. A string (character
array) is, however, already an address (a pointer), so we don't require
an extra <tt>&amp;</tt>. All these concepts will gradually be clear, as you
understand more and more of the idiosyncracies of C. For the time being
just rehearse and memorize the following two lines:
<pre>
   You need ampersands for all things,
   Unless you are scanning strings.
</pre>

<h3 align="left">Printing values</h3>
<p>
Printing is remarkably neater than scanning. No ampersands. And
<tt>printf</tt> prints precisely what you ask it to do. The basic
syntax is very similar to <tt>scanf</tt>.
<pre>
   printf(<i>control string</i>, arg1, arg2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
This directive causes the program to print the values of the arguments
<tt>arg1, arg2, ...</tt> to the terminal following the format specified in
the <i>control string</i>. The control string may contain (almost) any
sequence of characters with special escape sequences (starting with percents)
that determine how to print the arguments. The argumnets, on the other hand,
specify what to print. Here is a list of the basic escape sequences:
<p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Suppose you want to print the scanned values from the notorious <tt>scanf</tt>
example.
<pre>
   int a;
   unsigned long b;
   float x, y;
   char c, s[64];

   scanf("%d %x %f %e %c %s", &a, &b, &x, &y, &c, s);

   printf("a = %d = 0x%x\n", a, a);
   printf("b = %d = 0x%x\n", b, b);
   printf("x = %f = %e\n", x, x);
   printf("y = %f = %e\n", y, y);
   printf("c = '%c' = %d\n", c, c);
   printf("s = %s\n", s);
</pre>
<p>
If you supply the inputs
<pre>
   123 123 -123.456 1.23e-6 a Hey! I am your instructor.
</pre>
<p>
the <tt>printf</tt> statements print the following lines:
<pre>
   a = 123 = 0x7b
   b = 291 = 0x123
   x = -123.456001 = -1.234560e+02
   y = 0.000001 = 1.230000e-06
   c = 'a' = 97
   s = Hey!
</pre>
<p>
Once again you may combine several <tt>printf</tt>'s in a single statement.
For example, the same output is produced by the following:
<pre>
   printf("a = %d = 0x%x\nb = %d = 0x%x\n", a, a, b, b);
   printf("x = %f = %e\ny = %f = %e\n", x, x, y, y);
   printf("c = '%c' = %d\ns = %s\n", c, c, s);
</pre>
<p>
Here look at the dual meaning of characters. When viewed as a character,
it looks like <tt>a</tt>; when viewed as an integer, it looks like 97.
<p>
During <tt>printf</tt> no values are assigned. So <tt>printf</tt> can
legally handle printing values of expressions. Thus an argument of
<tt>printf</tt> can be any valid expression. For example, the following
snippet
<pre>
   int a = -3, b = 5;

   printf("expression1 = %d, and ", a / (a + b));
   printf("expression2 = %f.\n", (float)a / (float)(a + b));
   printf("That's all!\n");
</pre>
prints
<pre>
   expression1 = -1, and expression2 = -1.500000.
   That's all!
</pre>
<p>
There is a funny thing about <tt>printf</tt>. It indeed returns a value,
namely, the number of characters printed. Here is an example:
<pre>
   int a = -3, b = 5;
   int n;

   n = printf("expression1 = %d, and ", a / (a + b));
   n += printf("expression2 = %f.\n", (float)a / (float)(a + b));
   n += printf("That's all!\n");
   printf("Total number of characters printed before this line = %d\n", n);
</pre>
<p>
The output is
<pre>
   expression1 = -1, and expression2 = -1.500000.
   That's all!
   Total number of characters printed before this line = 59
</pre>
<p>
How come? You can see only 57 printed characters. Yep! You forgot to count
the new-line characters at the end of the first two lines.

<p>
<a name="fileio"></a>
<h2 align="left">File input/output</h2>
<p>
So far you have seen examples of I/O from/to the terminal. This is a
special case of what is called file I/O. You can read from or write to
any file using built-in functions that have call syntaxes very similar
to the standard I/O calls.
<p>
In order to use a file you must first open a <i>file pointer</i> or
a <i>file descriptor</i>. The <tt>fopen</tt> call can be used for that.
Here are the three basic ways of opening a file descriptor.
<pre>
   FILE *ifp, *ofp1, *ofp2;       /* Declare FILE pointers */

   ifp = fopen("foo.in","r");     /* Open the file "foo.in" in read mode */
   ofp1 = fopen("bar1.out","w");  /* Open the file "bar1.out" in write mode */
   ofp2 = fopen("bar2.out","a");  /* Open the file "bar2.out" in append mode */
</pre>
<p>
Once the file pointers are opened, they can be used for reading from or
writing to the named files. For the last example, the file "foo.in" is opened
in the "read" mode, i.e., you can read from the file "foo.in". The file
"bar1.out", on the other hand, is opened in the "write" mode. The file,
if existent, is rewritten, else a new file in the name "bar1.out" is
opened. You can write whatever you like to this file. Finally,
the file "bar2.out" is opened in the append mode. You can write to the
file "bar2.out". However, writing starts at the end. This means that
if a file with the name "bar2.out" already exists, then its content
is left unaltered, but now you get the facility to write to this file
starting from the end of the file. If "bar2.out" didn't exist, one
new file is created with this name and you can now start writing to it.
<p>
Reading from and writing to a file can be effected only via the FILE pointers
opened. The <tt>fopen</tt> call simply associates a file name and an access
mode with a FILE pointer.
<p>
If <tt>ifp</tt> is a FILE pointer opened in the read mode, you can read
from it using the directive:
<pre>
   fscanf(ifp, <i>control string</i>, &amp;var1, &amp;var2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
Here <i>control string</i> and the arguments are to be used exactly in the
same way as explained in connection with <tt>scanf</tt>.
<p>
Similarly, if <tt>ofp</tt> is a FILE pointer opened in the write or append
mode, one can use the following call for writing to the file:
<pre>
   fprintf(ofp, <i>control string</i>, expr1, expr2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
Like <tt>printf</tt>, the <i>control string</i> specifies how to print
and the arguments <tt>expr1, expr2, ...</tt> indicate what to print.
<p>
When your program starts execution, three FILE pointers are opened
by default. The standard input <tt>stdin</tt> is opened in the read mode
for scanning values from the terminal. The standard output <tt>stdout</tt>
and standard error <tt>stderr</tt> descriptors are opened in the append
mode. Both are meant for writing to the terminal. With special shell
commands one can separate out the two output streams. In Unix-like platforms
almost everything under the sun is treated as a file. Hard disk files look
like files, but the terminal is also a file and can be read from and written
to. In fact, the call
<pre>
   scanf(<i>control string</i>, &amp;var1, &amp;var2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to the call
<pre>
   fscanf(stdin, <i>control string</i>, &amp;var1, &amp;var2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, the call
<pre>
   printf(<i>control string</i>, expr1, expr2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to the call
<pre>
   fprintf(stdout, <i>control string</i>, expr1, expr2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
There are a lot of other things that you can do using FILE pointers.
We won't go into the details here. We only mention a new call to do
something useful: reading a string with spaces. The call goes like this:
<pre>
   fgets(str, n, ifp);
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>str</tt> is a character array, <tt>n</tt> a positive integer,
and <tt>ifp</tt> a FILE pointer opened in the read mode. The call reads
an entire line from the FILE pointer <tt>ifp</tt> and stores the line
with a trailing NULL character (<tt>'\0'</tt>) in the string <tt>str</tt>.
If the line in the input file is bigger than n characters, then only
n-1 characters are read and stored in <tt>str</tt> together with the
trailing NULL character. The array <tt>str</tt> should be large enough
to accommodate n characters. Using a smaller array may corrupt memory
and/or raise segmenation faults.
<p>
But what about reading an entire line from the terminal, as our original
problem was? You still wonder how! That's damn easy:
<pre>
   fgets(str, n, stdin);
</pre>
Period! Nay, semi-colon;
<p>
Once you are through working with a FILE pointer <tt>fp</tt> and do no
longer require it, you may explicitly close the pointer using the call:
<pre>
   fclose(fp);
</pre>
<p>
When your program terminates, all opened pointers (including the standard
ones) are closed. Doing it explicitly is a matter of good programming
etiquette and is on esoteric situations needed for your survival. Every
system imposes a restriction on the maximum number of FILE pointers that
can be opened simultaneously. This upper bound is compiler-dependent
and is usually not very high. If this value is 16, and you need to access
25 files, and if we assume you do not need to access all these 25 files
simultaneously, it is advantageous to close unused FILE pointers. These
closed descriptors may be reassigned in a subsequent <tt>fopen</tt>
call.
<p>
<a name="stringio"></a>
<h2 align="left">String input/output</h2>
Now I/O from/to a string. The concepts are similar. Use the <tt>sscanf</tt>
and <tt>sprintf</tt> calls.
<pre>
   sscanf(str, <i>control string</i>, &amp;var1, &amp;var2, ...);
   sprintf(str, <i>control string</i>, expr1, expr2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Here is a simple <tt>sscanf</tt> example:
<pre>
   char str[] = "53 -123.456 @";
   int a;
   float b;
   char c;

   sscanf(str,"%d %f %c", &a, &b, &c);
   printf("a = %d\nb = %f\nc = %d\n", a, b, c);
</pre>
<p>
This snippet generates the output:
<pre>
   a = 53
   b = -123.456001
   c = 64
</pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Here is a simple <tt>sprintf</tt> example:
<pre>
   char str[128];

   sprintf(str, "%lu %e\n", 521lu &lt;&lt; 9 , 521.0 * 512.0);
   fprintf(stdout, "%s", str);
</pre>
<p>
The output is
<pre>
   266752 2.667520e+05
</pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Now here is a deeply illustrating example:
<pre>
   int a = -3, b = 5;
   char str[128], *cptr;

   cptr = str;
   cptr += sprintf(cptr,"expression1 = %d, and ", a / (a + b));
   cptr += sprintf(cptr,"expression2 = %f.\n", (float)a / (float)(a + b));
   cptr += sprintf(cptr,"That's all!\n");
   printf("%s", str);
</pre>
<p>
You get the output:
<pre>
   expression1 = -1, and expression2 = -1.500000.
   That's all!
</pre>
<p>
Don't ask us to explain now what this code does. Let us wait till you
mature as a C programmer in order to understand, assimilate and eventually
appreciate the big idiosyncracies of C, its pointer arithmetic, its arrays,
bla bla bla. There is no hurry indeed.
<p>
Oh, didn't I mention that like <tt>printf</tt>, both <tt>fprintf</tt>
and <tt>sprintf</tt> return the number of characters printed? Furthermore,
each of <tt>scanf</tt>, <tt>fscanf</tt> and <tt>sscanf</tt> returns an
integer value. Read your system's manual if you have to know what this
return value stands for.
<p>
<a name="formattedio"></a>
<h2 align="left">Formatted input/output</h2>
<p>
You can control the format of printed output using special directives.
Using these extra directives helps you, for example, to generate nicely aligned
lines. All you have to do is to insert a number between the <tt>%</tt>
and the subsequent type specifier (<tt>d,x,f,s,</tt> etc.). The following
table summarizes some of these options. Here <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>
are assumed to be <i>positive</i> integer values.
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0">

as does <tt>%s</tt>.
<tr><td align="center"><tt>%<i>-n</i>s</tt><td><p>This is the same as <tt>%<i>n</i>s</tt>
except that the output is left-justified, i.e., extra spaces, if any,
are printed after the string.

<b>Example:</b>
For the following formatted print statements
<pre>
   printf("{%2d} {%3d} {%4d} {%-2d} {%-3d} {%-4d}\n",
          123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678);
   printf("{%2x} {%3x} {%4x} {%-2x} {%-3x} {%-4x}\n",
          123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678);
   printf("{%2s} {%3s} {%4s} {%-2s} {%-3s} {%-4s}\n",
          "abc", "bcd", "cde", "def", "efg", "fgh");
   printf("{%4.2f} {%5.2f} {%6.2f} {%-5.2f} {%-6.2f} {%-7.2f}\n",
          1.2345, 2.3456, 3.4567, -4.5678, -5.6789, -6.7890);
</pre>
<p>
the output looks like:
<pre>
   {123} {234} { 345} {456} {567} {678 }
   {7b} { ea} { 159} {1c8} {237} {2a6 }
   {abc} {bcd} { cde} {def} {efg} {fgh }
   {1.23} { 2.35} {  3.46} {-4.57} {-5.68 } {-6.79  }
