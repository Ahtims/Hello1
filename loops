<h1 align="center">Loops and iteration</h2>
<p>
This is the first time we are going to make an attempt to move backward in
a program. Loops make this backward movement feasible in a controlled manner.
This control is imparted by logical conditions.
<p>
Many problem-solving strategies involve repetitive steps. For example,
suppose we want to compute the sum of n numbers. A specific instance of
this problem is the computation of the <b>harmonic number</b>:
<pre>
   H<sub>n</sub> = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n.
</pre>
<p>
A reasonable strategy to solve this problem is to start with a sum
initialized to zero and then let each <tt>1/i</tt> be added to the sum.
When all of the n summands are added, the number accumulated in the sum
is the desired output. Here the repetitive part is the addition of the
next number to the current sum. So there should be a way to identify
the "next" number. Moreover, when there are no more (next) numbers,
the repetitive addition should stop. Here is a high-level
description of this process:
<pre>
   Initialize sum to 0.
   for each i in the set {1,2,...,n} add 1/i to sum.
   Report the accumulated sum as the output value.
</pre>
<p>
Here i identifies the "next" number and when all of the n possible values
of i have been tried out, the repetitive addition process should stop.

<p>
<a name="induction"></a>
<h2 align="left">Mathematical induction</h3>
<p>
Let us formalize the above notion of repetitive calculation. The following
sets occur frequently in the study of computer science. So let us designate
them by some special symbols.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whenever n is in S, so also is n+1.<br>

A similar theorem holds for the set <b>N<sub>0</sub></b>:

<b>Theorem:</b> [<i>Principle of mathematical induction</i>]<br>
<blockquote>
Let S be a subset of <b>N<sub>0</sub></b> with the following properties:<br>

<p>
The principle of mathematical induction can be stated in various equivalent
forms. The following is one such equivalent statement.
<p>
<b>Theorem:</b> [<i>Principle of strong mathematical induction</i>]<br>
<blockquote>
Let S be a subset of <b>N</b> with the following properties:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) 1 is in S.<br>

For <b>N<sub>0</sub></b> this can be stated as:

Then S = <b>N<sub>0</sub></b>.

<p>
Let us now see how we can exploit these principles for designing
iterative algorithms. First look at the the computation of harmonic numbers.
For the sake of simplicity let us also define:
<pre>
   H<sub>0</sub> = 0.
</pre>
<p>
Let S denote the set of all non-negative integers for which H<sub>n</sub>
can be computed. I will show that S&nbsp;=&nbsp;<b>N<sub>0</sub></b>.
First, H<sub>0</sub> is equal to the constant 0 and so can be computed;
so 0 is in S. Now suppose that H<sub>n</sub> can be computed for some
n&gt;=0, i.e., n is in S. It is easy to see that
<pre>
   H<sub>n+1</sub> = H<sub>n</sub> + 1/(n+1).
</pre>
<p>
But then since 1/(n+1) is also computable, adding this quantity to
H<sub>n</sub> gives us a way to compute H<sub>n+1</sub>, i.e., n+1 is
in S too. Hence by the principle of mathematical induction
S&nbsp;=&nbsp;<b>N<sub>0</sub></b>.
<p>
This argument not only establishes that H<sub>n</sub> can be computed
for all non-negative n, but also suggests a way to compute H<sub>n</sub>.
Here is the algorithm:
<pre>
   Set i = 0 and H<sub>0</sub> = 0.
   For i = 1,2,3,...,n in that order
      compute H<sub>i</sub> = H<sub>i-1</sub> + 1/i.
</pre>
<p>
We will shortly see how this English description can be translated to a
C program. For the time being let us concentrate on some other examples.
<p>
The <i>greatest common divisor</i> gcd(a,b) of two non-negative integers
(not both 0) is defined as the largest natural number of which both a and
b are integral multiples. The standard gcd algorithm taught in schools
is based on successive Euclidean division. Let us try to render it as a
sequence of repetitive computations. For the sake of simplicity, we assume
that whenever we write gcd(a,b) we mean a&gt;=b.
<p>
The first step is to show that gcd(a,b) is computable for all a&gt;=1 and
for all b in the range 0&lt;=b&lt;=a. We proceed by induction on a. If a=1,
we must have b=0 or b=1. Now both gcd(1,0) and gcd(1,1) equal the constant 1.
For the inductive step assume that gcd(a',b') is computable whenever a'&lt;a,
and that we want to compute gcd(a,b). We use the following theorem:
<p>
<b>Theorem:</b> [<i>Euclidean gcd theorem</i>]
<p>
Let a,b be positive integers and r&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;rem&nbsp;b.
Then gcd(a,b)&nbsp;=&nbsp;gcd(b,r).
<p>
Let us now come back to the inductive step. If a is an integral multiple
of b, we have r=0, and so by the theorem gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,0)=b. If
a is not an integral multiple of b, we cannot have a=b, i.e., now
a&gt;b. By the induction hypothesis gcd(b,r) is computable. Also the
remainder r is computable from a and b. Therefore, gcd(a,b) is also
computable.
<p>
This proof also leads to the following iterative algorithm:
<pre>
   As long as b is not equal to 0 do the following:
      Compute the remainder r = a rem b.
      Replace a by b and b by r.
   Report a as the desired gcd.
</pre>
<p>
<a name="recdef"></a>
<h2 align="left">Recursive definitions</h3>
<p>
A sequence a<sub>n</sub> for all n in <b>N</b> (or <b>N<sub>0</sub></b>)
can often be inductively (also called recursively) defined. For example,
the sequence of harmonic numbers is defined as:
<pre>
   H<sub>0</sub> = 0,
   H<sub>n</sub> = H<sub>n-1</sub> + (1/n) for n&gt;=1.
</pre>
<p>
The sequence a<sub>n</sub> = n<sup>2</sup> can be recursively defined as:
<pre>
   a<sub>0</sub> = 0,
   a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>n-1</sub> + 2n - 1 for n&gt;=1.
</pre>
<p>
Also recall the definition of <i>Fibonacci numbers</i>:
<pre>
   F<sub>0</sub> = 0,
   F<sub>1</sub> = 1,
   F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> for n&gt;=2.
</pre>
<p>
In all these cases the recursive definition provides a way to compute
an element in the sequence from one or more elements that occur earlier
in the sequence. The basis cases specify the terminal conditions, where
constant values are to be used for the initial elements of the sequence.
<p>
More complicated entities may also be defined recursively. For example,
suppose we want to obtain the list of all permutations of the natural
numbers 1,2,<tt>...</tt>,n. If n=1, the list consists of a single
element. For n&gt;=2, we inductively compute the list of permutations
of 1,2,<tt>...</tt>,n-1. Then for each permutation in the list we
insert n in any one of the n allowed positions. One can easily check
that in this way we can generate all the permutations of 1,2,<tt>...</tt>,n
with each such permutation generated exactly once.
<p>
Induction proves to be a useful methodology for attacking problems.
In the first place, it is procedural, i.e., it often leads to good algorithms
for computing recursively defined objects. Second, the idea of reduction
of a problem into one or more smaller problems and then combining the
solutions of the subproblems to obtain the solution of the original
problem turns out to be extremely useful for designing algorithms.
We will come back again to a discussion of recursion in connection
with functions.

<p>
<a name="loop"></a>
<h2 align="left">Loops</h3>
<p>
It is high time now that we concentrate on the realization of repetitive
structures in C. In the C terminology these are called <b>loops</b>.

<blockquote>
<h3 align="left">Pre-test and post-test loops</h3>
<p>
Loops can be broadly classified in two categories based on the location
where the condition for looping back is checked.
<p>
In a <b>pre-test loop</b> the condition for entering the body of the
loop is checked at the beginning (top) of the loop. If the condition
is satisfied, execution enters the body and proceeds sequentially.
After the entire body is executed, control comes back unconditionally
to the top of the loop. Meanwhile, the body might have changed the
world in a way so as to affect the continuation condition. If it is still
satisfied, the loop is entered once more, and the body is again
executed and control again comes back to the top of the loop. If
the condition at the top is not satisfied, the loop body is ignored
and the control of execution goes to the area after the end of the loop.
<p>
<center>
<img src="img/loop1.gif" alt="Pre-test loop"><br><br>
Figure: Pre-test loop
</center>
<p>
In a <b>post-test loop</b>, on the other hand, the control of execution
enters the loop body unconditionally. After the entire body is executed,
the loop condition is checked. If it is satisfied, control goes back to the
top of the loop, the body is again executed and the continuation condition
is again checked. This process is repeated until the continuation
condition becomes false. In that case, control leaves the loop and
proceeds further down the code.
<p>
<center>
<img src="img/loop2.gif" alt="Post-test loop"><br><br>
Figure: Post-test loop
</center>
<p>
It is important to note that for a post-test loop the loop body is executed
at least once, since control enters the body unconditionally. On the other
hand, in a pre-test loop the loop body need not be executed at all. If
the continuation condition is false initially, the entire loop is
ignored.

<h3 align="left">while loops</h3>
<p>
The pre-test loop of the above figure can be rendered in C as follows:
<pre>
   while (the continuation condition is true) {
      execute loop body;
   }
</pre>
<p>
If the loop body consists of a single statement, the braces may be omitted.
<p><b>Example:</b>
As a specific example of a while loop, let us implement the gcd algorithm
using repeated division.
<pre>
   while (b &gt; 0) {
      r = a % b;     /* Compute the next remainder */
      a = b;         /* Replace a by b */
      b = r;         /* Replace b by r */
   }
   printf("gcd = %d\n",a);
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b>
Here is how the n-th harmonic number may be computed using a while loop.
Note that <tt>H<sub>i</sub></tt> can be generated from
<tt>H<sub>i-1</sub></tt> and <tt>i</tt>. So
it is not necessary to store all the values
<tt>H<sub>0</sub>,H<sub>1</sub>,...,H<sub>i-1</sub></tt>. Remembering
only the previous harmonic number suffices.
<pre>
   float i, H;
   unsigned int n;

   ...

   i = 0;
   H = 0;
   while (i &lt; n) {
      ++i;          /* Increment i */
      H += 1.0/i;   /* Update the harmonic number accordingly */
   }
   printf("H(%d) = %f\n", n, H);
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
Finally, let us look at the computation of Fibonacci numbers using
while loops.
<pre>
   i = 1;    /* Initialize i to 1 */
   F = 1;    /* Initialize F<sub>i</sub> */
   p1 = 0;   /* Initialize F<sub>i-1</sub> */
   while (i &lt; n) {

      F = p1 + p2;  /* Compute F<sub>i</sub> from F<sub>i-1</sub> and F<sub>i-2</sub> */
   }
   printf("F(%d) = %d", n, F);
</pre>

<h3 align="left">do-while loops</h3>
<p>
The do-while loop of C is a post-test loop. It has the following syntax:
<pre>
   do {
      execute loop body;
   } while (continuation condition is true);
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
Harmonic numbers can be computed using the do-while loop as:
<pre>
   float i, H;
   unsigned int n;

   ...

   i = 0;
   H = 0;
   do {
      ++i;          /* Increment i */
      H += 1.0/i;   /* Update the harmonic number accordingly */
   } while (i &lt; n);
   printf("H(%d) = %f\n", n, H);
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
The following loop computes the gcd of two integers a,b with
<tt>1&lt;=b&lt;=a</tt>.
<pre>
   do {
      r = a % b;     /* Compute the next remainder */
      a = b;         /* Replace a by b */
      b = r;         /* Replace b by r */
   } while (b &gt; 0);
   printf("gcd = %d\n",a);
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
Finally, here is an implementation of the computation of Fibonacci
numbers <tt>F<sub>i</sub></tt> for <tt>i&gt;=2</tt>.
<pre>
   i = 1;    /* Initialize i to 1 */
   F = 1;    /* Initialize F<sub>i</sub> */

<h3 align="left">for loops</h3>
<p>
These are <i>pre-test</i> loops and have the following syntax:
<pre>
   for ( initialize loop; continuation condition ; loop increment ) {
      execute loop body;
   }
</pre>
<p>
Here the loop initialization step consists of a set of book-keeping task
that need be carried out before entering the loop, and the loop increment
step refers to a set of tasks carried out at the end of the loop body
just before the continuation condition is checked. The for loop can be
equivalently described in terms of the following while loop:
<pre>
   initialize loop;
   while (continuation condition is true) {
      execute loop body;
      loop increment;
   }
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
One can compute gcds using for loops as follows:
<pre>
   for ( ; b &gt; 0 ; ) {
      r = a % b;     /* Compute the next remainder */
      a = b;         /* Replace a by b */
      b = r;         /* Replace b by r */
   }
</pre>
<p>
Here the initialization and increment steps are empty.
<p><b>Example:</b>
Computation of harmonic numbers using for loops is quite simple:
<pre>
   H = 0;
   for (i=1; i&lt;=n; ++i) H += 1.0/i;
   printf("H(%d) = %f\n", n, H);
</pre>
<p><b>Example:</b>
If more than one statements need be executed during the initialization
or increment step, they should be separated by commas, since semi-colons
indicate separation of the three parts of the loop control area.
<p>
The Fibonacci computation may have the following form with for loops. We
assume that n&gt;=2.
<pre>
   for ( i = 2, p1 = 1, p2 = 0; i &lt;= n; ++i , p2 = p1 , p1 = F ) 
      F = p1 + p2;  /* Compute F<sub>i</sub> from F<sub>i-1</sub> and F<sub>i-2</sub> */
   printf("F(%d) = %d", n, F);

sequence 1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+<tt>...</tt>+n<sup>2</sup>.

A[0]&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;A[1]&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<tt>...</tt>&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;A[n-1].
First we compare the element x with the array element A[(n-1)/2].
If x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;A[(n-1)/2], then x cannot be found in the first half
of the array. On the other hand, if x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;A[(n-1)/2], there is
no need to search x in the second half of the array. Thus by a single
comparison we discard one half of the array. We then repeat the process,
every time discarding half of the remaining part of the array. Eventually,
we reduce the search to a single array element and check whether x equals
this element.

<a name="loopinv"></a>
<h2 align="left">Loop invariants</h3>
<p>
For verifying the correctness of loops one often uses the concept of
<b>loop invariance</b>. A loop invariant refers to a statement that is
true at all instants when the loop condition is checked. It may be expressed
in terms of one or more variables controlling the flow of the loop.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Consider the while loop implementation of the computation of <tt>H<sub>n</sub></tt>.
<pre>
   i = 0;
   H = 0;
   while (i < n) {
      ++i;          /* Incremet i */
      H += 1.0/i;   /* Update the harmonic number accordingly */
   }
</pre>
<p>
Here the loop invariant is the statement "<tt>H</tt> stores the value <tt>H<sub>i</sub></tt>
for all <tt>i=0,1,2,...,n</tt>". The correctness of this statement can be
proved using induction on i. It is initially true (<tt>H<sub>0</sub>=0</tt>).
Now suppose it is true for a particular <tt>i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n</tt>. As the loop body is
executed the value of <tt>i</tt> changes to <tt>i+1</tt> and that of <tt>H</tt> changes to
<tt>H<sub>i</sub>+1/(i+1)=H<sub>i+1</sub></tt>. The loop terminates when <tt>i</tt> equals <tt>n</tt>.
By the loop invariance property <tt>H</tt> then stores the value <tt>H<sub>n</sub></tt>.
This is precisely what we wanted to compute.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Next look at the do-while implementation of Fibonacci computation.
<pre>
   i = 1;    /* Initialize i to 1 */
   F = 1;    /* Initialize F<sub>i</sub> */
   p1 = 0;   /* Initialize F<sub>i-1</sub> */
   do {
      ++i;          /* Increment i */
      p2 = p1;      /* The old F<sub>i-1</sub> now becomes F<sub>i-2</sub> */
      p1 = F;       /* The old F<sub>i</sub> now becomes F<sub>i-1</sub> */
      F = p1 + p2;  /* Compute F<sub>i</sub> from F<sub>i-1</sub> and F<sub>i-2</sub> */
   } while (i < n);
</pre>
<p>
It is easy to check that an invariant for this loop is the statement
"<tt>F</tt> holds the value <tt>F<sub>i</sub></tt> and <tt>p1</tt> the value
<tt>F<sub>i-1</sub></tt>" and is true for <tt>i=1,2,...,</tt>n. The loop
terminates for <tt>i=n</tt>, and in that case <tt>F</tt> stores <tt>F<sub>n</sub></tt> as desired.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Here is a new example. Suppose we want to compute the maximum of
n positive integers stored in an array A.
<pre>
   max = A[0];
   for (i=1; i&lt;n; ++i) {
      if (A[i] &gt; max) max = A[i];
   }
</pre>
<p>
A loop invariant here is "<tt>max</tt> stores the maximum value among
the integers <tt>A[0],A[1],...,A[i-1]</tt>" and is true for all
<tt>i=1,2,...,n</tt>.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Let us now come to a really non-trivial example of loop invariance.
<p>
<b>Theorem:</b> Let a,b be positive integers and d&nbsp;=&nbsp;gcd(a,b).
Then there exist integers u,v with the property that
ua&nbsp;+&nbsp;vb&nbsp;=&nbsp;d.
<p>
Computation of the gcd d along with the multipliers u,v is called the
<b>extended gcd</b> computation. The following algorithm does that.
<pre>
   /* Initialize */
   r2 = a; u2 = 1; v2 = 0;  /* Previous-to-previous values */
   r1 = b; u1 = 0; v1 = 1;  /* Previous values */

   /* Extended gcd loop */
   while (r1 &gt; 0) {
      /* Compute values for the current iteration */
      q = r2 / r1;       /* Compute the next quotient */
      r = r2 - q * r1;   /* Compute the next remainder */
      u = u2 - q * u1;   /* Identically compute the next u value */
      v = v2 - q * v1;   /* Identically compute the next v value */

      /* Prepare for the next iteration */
      r2 = r1; u2 = u1; v2 = v1;  /* Let the previous-to-previous values be the previous values */
      r1 = r; u1 = u; v2 = v;     /* Let the previous values be the current values */
   }

   printf("gcd(a,b) = %d = (%d) * a + (%d) * b\n", r2, u2, v2);
</pre>

</table>
<p>
It is not at all clear that this algorithm works correctly. The correctness
can be established from the following invariance property:
<p>
<b>Claim:</b> Whenever the continuation condition for the above loop is
checked, we have:
<pre>
   gcd(r2,r1) = gcd(a,b),      (1)
   u2 * a + v2 * b = r2,       (2)
   u1 * a + v1 * b = r1.       (3)
</pre>
<p>
<i>Proof</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The three conditions are obviously true at the beginning of the first
iteration; this is how the values are initialized. Now suppose that the
relations hold for certain iteration with r1&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0. The loop
body is then executed. First, the quotient q and the remainder r of
Euclidean division of r2 by r1 is computed. By Euclid's gcd theorem
<pre>
   gcd(r1,r) = gcd(r2,r1) = gcd(a,b).
</pre>
<p>
Moreover,
<pre>
   u = u2 - q * u1, and v = v2 - q * v1,
</pre>
<p>
and so
<pre>
     u * a + v * b
   = (u2 - q * u1) * a + (v2 - q * v1) * b
   = (u2 * a + v2 * b) - q * (u1 * a + v1 * b)
   = r2 - q * r1
   = r.
</pre>
<p>
Thus the three equations (1)-(3) continue to be satisfied for the
new r,u,v values. QED
<p>
The loop terminates when r1 becomes 0. In that case gcd(a,b) =
gcd(r2,r1) = gcd(r2,0) = r2 = u2 * a + v2 * b, and, therefore,
r2,u2,v2 constitute a desired set of values for the extended gcd.
<p>
Let us look at the trace of the values stored in different variables
for a sample run with a=78 and b=21.

<a name="nestedloop"></a>
<h2 align="left">Nested loops</h3>
<p>
One or more loops can be nested inside another loop. In that case the inner loops
usually have continuation conditions dependent on variables different from the
variable(s) governing the continuation of the outer loop. The programmer should
be sufficiently careful so as not to do something silly inside the inner loops,
that affects the behavior of the outer loop.
<p>
<b>Example:</b> [<i>Bubble sort</i>]
<p>
Suppose you have an array A of n elements (say, integers). They are stored in
the array locations A[0],A[1],<tt>...</tt>,A[n-1]. We want to rearrange these
integers in such a way that after the rearrangement we have
<pre>
   A[0] &lt;= A[1] &lt;= A[2] &lt;= ... &lt;= A[n-1].
</pre>
<p>
Such an array is called a <b>sorted array</b> and the process of making
the array sorted is refered to as <b>sorting</b>. Sorting is a basic and
fundamental computational problem. There are several algorithms proposed
for sorting. For the time being, let us look at an algorithm known as
<b>bubble sort</b>.
<p>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" border="0">
<tr>
<td><h3><a id="noul" href="swf/bubble.html">Animation example : bubble sort</a></h3>
<td><h3><a id="noul" href="http://webmail.iitkgp.ac.in/people/chittaranjan.mandal/interactive/bubbleSort/">Interactive animation : bubble sort</a></h3>
</table>
<p>
The bubble sort algorithm can be implemented using a singly nested loop
as follows:
<pre>
   for (i=n-2; i&gt;=0; --i) {    /* Attempt to bubble till the value of i */
      for (j=0; j&lt;=i; ++j) {   /* Run j from 0 to the current upper bound i */
         if (A[j] &gt; A[j+1]) {  /* Two consecutive elements are in the opposite order */
                               /* Swap A[j] and A[j+1] */
            t = A[j];          /* Store A[j] in a temporary variable t */
            A[j] = A[j+1];     /* Change A[j] to A[j+1] */
            A[j+1] = t;        /* Change A[j+1] to the old value of A[j] stored in t */
         }
      }
   }
</pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> [<i>Selection sort</i>]
<p>
The working of the selection sort is somewhat similar to that of bubble
sort. Here the outer loop runs over i ranging from n-1 down to 1. For a
given i, the largest element in the subarray A[0],A[1],<tt>...</tt>,A[i]
is found out and is swapped with the element A[i]. Thus during the first
iteration of the outer loop A[n-1] receives the largest element in the
array, in the second iteration A[n-2] receives the second largest
element, and so on.
<p>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" border="0">

<td><h3><a id="noul" href="http://webmail.iitkgp.ac.in/people/chittaranjan.mandal/interactive/selectionSort/">Interactive animation : selection sort</a></h3>
</table>
<p>
The code for selection sort follows:
<pre>
   for (i=n-1; i&gt;=1; --i) {
      /* First find the maximum element of A[0],A[1],...,A[i] */
      /* Initialize maximum entry to be the leftmost one */
      maxidx = 0;
      max = A[0];
      /* Now search for a potentially bigger maximum */
      for (j=1; j&lt;=i; ++j) {
         if (A[j] &gt; max) {  /* An element bigger that the current maximum is located */
            /* Adjust the maximum entry */
            maxidx = j;
            max = A[j];
         }
      }
      /* Swap A[i] with the maximum element */
      A[maxidx] = A[i];  /* Store the last element at index maxidx */
      A[i] = max;        /* Store the maximum at the last index */
   }
</pre>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> [<i>Insertion sort</i>]
<p>
Here is yet another sorting algorithm that uses nested loops. Here the outer
loop runs over a variable i ranging from 1 to n-1. For a particular i,
the portion A[0],A[1],<tt>...</tt>,A[i-1] is already sorted. Then
the element A[i] is considered and is <i>inserted</i> at the appropriate
position in the sorted list A[0],A[1],<tt>...</tt>,A[i-1]. That will
make a bigger sorted list A[0],A[1],<tt>...</tt>,A[i]. When the loop
body finishes execution with i=n, the entire array is sorted.

Here is the code for insertion sort.
<pre>
   for (i=1; i&lt;n; ++i) {        /* Consider A[i] */
      /* Search for the correct insertion location of A[i] */
      t = A[i];                 /* Store A[i] in a temporary variable */
      j = 0;                    /* Initialize search location */
      while (t &gt; A[j]) ++j;     /* Skip smaller entries */
      /* Here j holds the desired insertion location */

      /* Shift forward the remaining entries each by one location */
      for (k=i-1; k&gt;=j; --k) A[k+1] = A[k];

      /* Finally insert the old A[i] at the j-th location */
      A[j] = t;
   }
</pre>

<p>
<a name="loopcontrol"></a>
<h2 align="left">Flow control inside loops</h3>
<p>
The continuation condition dictates whether the loop body is to be
repeated or skipped. There are some constructs by which this natural
flow can be altered.
<blockquote>
<h3 align="left">The <tt>break</tt> statement</h3>
<p>
A loop may be forcibly broken from inside irrespective of whether
the continuation condition is satisfied or not. This is achieved by
the <tt>break</tt> statement.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
Let us write the gcd algorithm with explicit break statement.
Here we make the loop an infinite one. The check whether b equals 0
is carried out inside the loop. If the check succeeds, the loop is
broken explicitly by a break statement.
<pre>
   while (1) {
      if (b == 0) break;
      r = a % b;
      a = b;
      b = r;
   }
   printf("gcd = %d\n", a);
</pre>
<p>
Note that any loop can be implemented as an infinite loop with an explicit
break. The do-while loop
<pre>
   do {
      execute loop body;
   } while (continuation condition is true);
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to
<pre>
   do {
      execute loop body;
      if (continuation condition is false) break;
   } while (1);
</pre>
<p>
and also to
<pre>
   while (1) {
      execute loop body;
      if (continuation condition is false) break;
   }
</pre>
<p>

</table>
<p>
In case of nested loops, a <tt>break</tt> statement causes the
innermost loop (in which the statement is executed) to be broken.
As a toy example, suppose that we want to compute the sum of
gcds of all pairs (a,b) with 1&lt;=a&lt;=b&lt;=20. Here is an
implementation with explicit break statements.
<pre>
   /* Initialize sum */
   sum = 0;

   for (i=1; i&lt;=20; ++i) {
      for (j=i; j&lt;=20; ++j) {
         /* Now we plan to compute gcd(j,i) */
         /* But we must not disturb the loop variables */
         /* So we copy j and i to temporary variables a and b and change those copies */
         a = j; b = i;

         /* The Euclidean gcd loop */
         while (1) {
            if (b == 0) break; /* gcd computation is over, so break the while loop */
            r = a % b;
            a = b;
            b = r;
         }

         /* When the while loop is broken, a contains gcd(j,i). Add it to the accumulating sum. */
         sum += a;
      }
   }
   printf("The desired sum = %d\n", sum);
</pre>
<p>
Next follows a more obfuscating implementation of the same algorithm. Here all
the loops are broken with explicit break statements. Moreover, the break
statements occur in the middle of the loops. Finally, the gcd loop is rewritten
so that we can break as soon as we find a zero remainder. In that case,
b holds the desired gcd.
<pre>
   sum = 0;                    /* Initialize sum to 0 */
   i = 0;                      /* Initialize the outer loop variable */
   while (1 != 0) {            /* This condition is always true */
      j = ++i;                 /* Increment i and assign the incremented value to j */
      if (j == 21) break;      /* Break the outermost loop */
      while (3.1416 &gt; 0) {     /* This condition is always true */
         a = j; b = i;         /* Copy j and i to temporary variables */
         while ('A') {         /* This condition is again always true, since 'A' = 65 */
            r = a % b;         /* Compute next remainder */
            if (!r) break;     /* Break the innermost loop */
            a = b;             /* Adjust a and b and */
            b = r;             /* prepare for the next iteration */
         }                     /* End of innermost loop */
         sum += b;             /* Add gcd(j,i) to the accumulating sum */
         if (j == 20) break;   /* Break the intermediate loop */
         ++j;                  /* Prepare for the next value of j */
      }                        /* End of intermediate loop */
   }                           /* End of outermost loop */
   printf("The desired sum = %d\n", sum);
</pre>
<p>
Well then, is it a good style to write programs this way? Certainly no!
This makes your code quite unreadable to (and hence unusable by) others.
Even if some code is meant for your personal consumption only, debugging
it may cause you enough headache, in particular, when you are already
pretty tired or hungry and plan to finish the day's programming as early
as possible.
<p>
Programming is fun anyway. For the kick you may at your leisure time make
attempts to write and/or understand obfuscated codes. So then, what does
the following program print (as a function of n)?
<pre>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   main ()
   {
      unsigned int n, i, j, s;

      printf("Enter a positive integer : ");
      scanf("%d",&n);
      s = 0x00000041 ^ (unsigned int)'A';
      while (i = --n) while (j = --i) while (--j) ++s;
      printf("s = %d\n", s);
   }
</pre>
<h3 align="left">The <tt>continue</tt> statement</h3>
<p>
The <tt>continue</tt> statement also affects the normal execution of
a loop. It does not cause the loop to terminate, but throws the control
to the top of the loop ignoring the remaining part of the loop body
for the <i>current</i> iteration.
<p><b>Example:</b>
Suppose we want to print the integers 1,2,<tt>...</tt>,100 neatly
with 10 integers printed in a line. Here is how this can be done:
<pre>
   for (i=1; i&lt;=100; ++i) {
      printf("%4d",i);
      if (i%10 != 0) continue;
      printf("\n");
   }
</pre>
<p>
Here if i is a multiple of 10, the new line character is printed.
Otherwise the continue statement lets the control flow reach the top of the
loop, i.e., to the loop increment area where the variable i is incremented.
The same effect can be realized by the following while loop:
<pre>
   i = 0;
   while (i &lt; 100) {
      ++i;
      printf("%4d",i);
      if (i%10 != 0) continue;
      printf("\n");
   }
