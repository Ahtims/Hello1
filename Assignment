<p>
Initialization during declaration helps one store <i>constant</i> values
in memory allocated to variables. Later one typically does a sequence
of the following:
<ul>
<p><li>Read the values stored in variables.
<p><li>Do some operations on these values.
<p><li>Store the result back in some variable.
</ul>
This three-stage process is effected by an <b>assignment operation</b>.
A generic assignment operation looks like:
<pre>
   <i>variable</i> = <i>expression</i>;
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt><i>expression</i></tt> consists of variables and constants combined using
arithmetic and logical operators. The equality sign (<tt>=</tt>) is the
<b>assignment operator</b>. To the left of this operator resides the name
of a variable. All the variables present in <tt><i>expression</i></tt> are loaded to
the CPU. The ALU then evaluates the expression on these values. The
final result is stored in the location allocated to <tt><i>variable</i></tt>.
The semicolon at the end is mandatory and denotes that the particular
statement is over. It is a statement <i>delimiter</i>, <u>not</u> a statement
<i>separator</i>.

<p>
A C program typically consists of a sequence of statements. They are
executed one-by-one from top to bottom (unless some explicit jump instruction
or function call is encountered). This sequential execution of statements
gives C a distinctive <b>imperative</b> flavor. This means that the
sequence in which statements are executed decides the final values stored
in variables. Let us illustrate this using an example:
<pre>
   int x = 43, y = 15;   /* Two integer variables are declared and initialized */

   x = y + 5;  /* The value 15 of y is fetched and added to 5.
                  The sum 20 is stored in the memory location for x. */
   y = x;      /* The value stored in x, i.e., 20 is fetched and stored
                  back in y. */
</pre>
<p>
After these statements are executed both the memory locations for x and y
store the integer value 20.
<p>
Let us now switch the two assignment operations.
<pre>
   int x = 43, y = 15;   /* Two integer variables are declared and initialized */

   y = x;      /* The value stored in x, i.e., 43 is fetched and stored
                  back in y. */
   x = y + 5;  /* The value 43 of y is fetched and added to 5.
                  The sum 48 is stored in the memory location for x. */
</pre>
<p>
For this sequence, x stores the value 48 and y the value 43, after the two
assignment statements are executed.
<p>
The right side of an assignment operation may contain multiple occurrences
of the same variable. For each such occurrence the same value stored in
the variable is substituted. Moreover, the variable in the left side of
the assignment operator may appear in the right side too. In that case,
each occurrence in the right side refers to the older (pre-assignment) value
of the variable. After the expression is evaluated, the value of the variable
is updated by the result of the evaluation.  For example, consider the
following:
<pre>
  int x = 5;

  x = x + (x * x);
</pre>
<p>
The value 5 stored in x is substituted for each occurrence of x in the right
side, i.e., the expression 5 + (5 * 5) is evaluated. The result is 30 and
is stored back to x. Thus, this assignment operation causes the value of x
to change from 5 to 30. The equality sign in the assignment statement is
not a mathematical equality, i.e., the above statement does <u>not</u>
refer to the equation <tt>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup></tt>
(which happens to have a single root, namely <tt>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</tt>).
It similarly makes sense to write
<pre>
   z = z + 2;
</pre>
<p>
to imply an assignment (increment the value of z by 2). Mathematically,
it makes little sense, since no numbers you know seem to satisfy the equation
<tt>z&nbsp;=&nbsp;z&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</tt>. (But I know some of them!)
Notice that in C there is a different way for checking equality of two
expressions. The single equality sign is not that.
<p>
Floating point numbers, characters and array locations may also be used
in assignment operations.
<pre>
   float a = 2.3456, b = 6.5432, c[5];  /* Declare float variables and arrays */
   char d, e[4];                        /* Declare character variables and arrays */

   c[0] = a + b;         /* c[0] is assigned 2.3456 + 6.5432, i.e., 8.8888 */
   c[1] = a - c[0];      /* c[1] is assigned 2.3456 - 8.8888, i.e., -6.5432 */
   c[2] = b - c[0];      /* c[2] is assigned 6.5432 - 8.8888, i.e., -2.3456 */
   a = c[1] + c[2];      /* a is assigned (-6.5432) + (-2.3456), i.e., -8.8888 */

   d = 'A' - 1;          /* d is assigned the character ('@') one less than 'A' in the ASCII chart */
   e[0] = d + 1;         /* e[0] is assigned the character next to '@', i.e., 'A' */
   e[1] = e[0] + 1;      /* e[1] is assigned the character next to 'A', i.e., 'B' */
   e[2] = e[0] + 2;      /* e[2] is assigned the character second next to 'A', i.e., 'C' */
   e[3] = e[2] + 1;      /* e[3] is assigned the character next to 'C', i.e., 'D' */
</pre>
<p>
An assignment does an implicit type conversion, if its left side turns out
to be of a different data type than the type of the expression evaluated.
<pre>
   float a = 7.89, b = 3.21;
   int c;

   c = a + b;
</pre>
<p>
Here the right side involves the floating point operation
7.89&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.21. The result is the floating point value 11.1.
The assignment plans to store this result in an integer variable.
The value 11.1 is first truncated and subsequently the integer value
11 is stored in <tt>c</tt>. One can explicitly mention this typecasting
command as:
<pre>
   float a = 7.89, b = 3.21;
   int c;

   c = (int)(a + b);
</pre>
<p>
The parentheses around the expression <tt>a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b</tt> implies
that the typecasting is to be done after the evaluation of the
expression. The following variant has a different effect:
<pre>
   float a = 7.89, b = 3.21;
   int c;

   c = (int)a + b;
</pre>
<p>
Here a is first converted to 7 and then added to 3.21. The resulting
value (10.21) is truncated and stored in c. That is, now c is assigned
the value 10.
<p>
In C, an assignment operation also <i>returns</i> a value. It is precisely
the value that is assigned. This value can again be used in an expression.
<pre>
   int a, b, c;

   c = (a = 8) + (b = 13);
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>a</tt> is assigned the value 8 and <tt>b</tt> the value 13.
The values (8 and 13) returned by these assignments are then added
and the sum 21 is stored in c. The assignment of c also returns a
value, i.e., 21. Here we have ignored this value. Assignment is
<i>right associative</i>. For example,
<pre>
   a = b = c = 0;
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to
<pre>
   a = (b = (c = 0));
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>c</tt> is first assigned the value 0. This value is returned
to assign <tt>b</tt>, i.e., <tt>b</tt> also gets the value 0. The value
returned from this second assignment is then assigned to <tt>a</tt>.
Thus after this statement all of <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt>
are assigned the value 0.

<h2 align="left">Built-in operators</h3>
<p>
Now that we know how to assign values to variables, what remains is a
discussion on how expressions can be generated. Here are the rules:
<ul>
<p><li>A constant is an expression.
<p><li>A (defined) variable is an expression.
<p><li>If E is an expression, then so also is (E).
<p><li>If E is an expression and <i>op</i> a unary operator defined in C,
then <i>op</i>&nbsp;E is again an expression.
<p><li>If E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> are expressions and <i>op</i> is
a binary operator defined in C, then E<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>op</i>&nbsp;E<sub>2</sub>
is again an expression.
<p><li>If V is a variable and E is an expression, then V&nbsp;=&nbsp;E is
also an expression.
</ul>
<p>
These rules do not exhaust all possibilities for generating expressions,
but form a handy set to start with.
<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
<pre>
   53                  /* constant */
   -3.21               /* constant */
   'a'                 /* constant */
   x                   /* variable */
   -x[0]               /* unary negation on a variable */
   x + 5               /* addition of two subexpressions */
   (x + 5)             /* parenthesized expression */
   (x) + (((5)))       /* another parenthesized expression */
   y[78] / (x + 5)     /* more complex expression */
   y[78] / x + 5       /* another complex expression */
   y / (x = 5)         /* expression involving assignment */
   1 + 32.5 / 'a'      /* expression involving different data types */
</pre>
<p>
<b>Non-examples:</b>
<pre>
   5 3                 /* space is not an operator and integer constants may not contain spaces */
   y *+ 5              /* *+ is not a defined operator */
   x (+ 5)             /* badly placed parentheses */
   x = 5;              /* semi-colons are not allowed in expressions */
</pre>
<p>
We now list the basic operators defined in C and the interpretations of these
operators.

<blockquote>
<h3 align="left">Arithmetic operators</h4>
<p>
Arithmetic operators include negation, addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division. The result of the operation depends on which type of data
the arithmetic operator operates on. The following table summarizes the
relevant information.
<p>
<center>

<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
Here are examples of integer arithmetic:
<pre>
   55 + 21 evaluates to 76.
   55 - 21 evaluates to 34.
   55 * 21 evaluates to 1155.
   55 / 21 evaluates to 2.
   55 % 21 evaluates to 13.
</pre>
<p>
Here are some examples of floating point arithmetic:
<pre>
   55.0 + 21.0 evaluates to 76.0.
   55.0 - 21.0 evaluates to 34.0.
   55.0 * 21.0 evaluates to 1155.0.
   55.0 / 21.0 evaluates to 2.6190476 (approximately).
   55.0 % 21.0 is not defined.
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> C does <u>not</u> provide a built-in exponentiation operator.
<h3 align="left">Bitwise operators</h4>
<p>
Bitwise operations apply to unsigned integer operands and work on
each individual bit. Bitwise operations on signed integers give
results that depend on the compiler used, and so are not recommended
in good programs. The following table summarizes the bitwise operations.
For illustration we use two <tt>unsigned char</tt> operands <tt>a</tt>
and <tt>b</tt>. We assume that <tt>a</tt> stores the value
237&nbsp;=&nbsp;(11101101)<sub>2</sub> and that <tt>b</tt> stores
the value 174&nbsp;=&nbsp;(10101110)<sub>2</sub>.

</center>
<h3 align="left">Some shorthand notations</h4>
<p>
C provides some shorthand notations for some particular kinds of operations.
For example, if the variable to be assigned is the first operand in the
expression on the right side, then this variable may be omitted in the
expression and the operator comes <i>before</i> the equality sign.
More precisely, the assignment
<pre>
   <i>var</i> = <i>var</i> <i>op</i> <i>expression</i>;
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to
<pre>
   <i>var</i> <i>op</i>= <i>expression</i>;
</pre>
<p>
Here the operator <i>op</i> can be any binary operator described above,
namely, <tt>+,-,*,/,%,&amp;,|,^,&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;</tt>.
Some specific examples are:
<pre>
   a = a + 10.43;        is equivalent to   a += 10.43;
   a = a % 43;           is equivalent to   a %= 43;
   c = c * (a + b - c);  is equivalent to   c *= a + b - c;
   a = a &gt;&gt; 3;           is equivalent to   a &gt;&gt;= 3;
   b = b ^ (a &lt;&lt; 3);     is equivalent to   b ^= (a &lt;&lt; 3);
</pre>
<p>
A special case of this can be shortened further: increment/decrement by 1.
<pre>
   a = a + 1; is equivalent to a += 1; which is also equivalent to ++a;
   b = b - 1; is equivalent to b -= 1; which is also equivalent to --b;
</pre>
<p>
These increment/decrement operators (<tt>++</tt> and <tt>--</tt>) are called
<b>pre-increment</b> and <b>pre-decrement</b> operators. C also provides
<b>post-increment</b> and <b>post-decrement</b> operators. These operators
are same (<tt>++</tt> and <tt>--</tt>) but are written <i>after</i> the
variable being incremented/decremented. The isolated statements
<pre>
   a++;
   b--;
</pre>
<p>
are respectively equivalent to
<pre>
   ++a;
   --b;
</pre>
<p>
However, there is a subtle difference between the two. Recall that every
assignment returns a value. The increment (or decrement) expressions
<tt>++a</tt> and <tt>a++</tt> are also assignment expressions. Both stand
for "increment the value of <tt>a</tt> by 1". But then which value of
<tt>a</tt> is returned by this expression? We have the following rules:
<ul>
<p><li>For <tt>a++</tt> the older value of <tt>a</tt> is returned and then
the value of <tt>a</tt> is incremented. This is why it is called the
post-increment operation.
<p><li>For <tt>++a</tt> the value of <tt>a</tt> is first incremented and
this new (incremented) value of <tt>a</tt> is returned. This is why it is
called the pre-increment operation.
</ul>
<p>
A similar argument holds for the decrement operations. The following examples
illustrate the differences:
<pre>
   a = 43;
   b = 15;
   c = (++a) * (--b);
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>a</tt> is first incremented and the value 44 is returned. Also
<tt>b</tt> is decremented and the value 14 is returned. Then these two
values are multiplied and the product 44*14&nbsp;=&nbsp;616 is assigned to <tt>c</tt>.
<pre>
   a = 43;
   b = 15;
   c = (++a) * (b--);
</pre>
<p>Now <tt>a</tt> is first incremented and the value 44 is returned.
But the value of <tt>b</tt> is first returned (15) and then decremented.
Thus <tt>c</tt> gets the value 44*15&nbsp;=&nbsp;660. Similarly, after
the execution of the following statements
<pre>
   a = 43;
   b = 15;
   c = (a++) * (b--);
</pre>
<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt> respectively hold the values
44, 14 and 43*15&nbsp;=&nbsp;645.
<h3 align="left">Precedence of operators</h4>
<p>
An explicitly parenthesized arithmetic (and/or logical) expression
clearly indicates the sequence of operations to be performed on its
arguments. However, it is quite common that we do not write all the
parentheses in such expressions. Instead, we use some rules of
precedence and associativity, that make the sequence clear. For example,
the expression
<pre>
   a + b * c
</pre>
<p>
conventionally stands for
<pre>
   a + (b * c)
</pre>
<p>
and not for
<pre>
   (a + b) * c
</pre>
<p>
The reason is that the multiplication operator has higher <i>precedence</i>
than the addition operator. This means that <tt>*</tt> attracts the
<i>common</i> operand <tt>b</tt> more forcibly than <tt>+</tt> does.
As a result, <tt>b</tt> becomes an operand for <tt>*</tt> and not for
<tt>+</tt>. Note that in general these two expressions evaluate to different
values. For example, 40&nbsp;+&nbsp;(15&nbsp;*&nbsp;7) equals 145,
whereas (40&nbsp;+&nbsp;15)&nbsp;*&nbsp;7 evaluates to 385. It is,
therefore, necessary that when we write 40&nbsp;+&nbsp;15&nbsp;*&nbsp;7,
we precisely understand which way we plan to resolve the ambiguity.
<p>
In order to explain another source of ambiguity, let us look at the expression
<pre>
   a - b - c
</pre>
<p>
Now the <i>common</i> operand <tt>b</tt> belongs to two same operators
(subtraction). They have the same precedence. Now we can evaluate this as
<pre>
   (a - b) - c
</pre>
<p>
or as
<pre>
   a - (b - c)
</pre>
<p>
Again the two expressions may evaluate to different values. For example,
(40&nbsp;-&nbsp;15)&nbsp;-&nbsp;7 is 18, whereas
40&nbsp;-&nbsp;(15&nbsp;-&nbsp;7) is 32. The convention is that the
first interpretation is correct. In other words, the subtraction
operator is <i>left-associative</i>.
<p>
C is no exception to these conventional interpretations. You need not
fully parenthesize a composite expression. C applies the standard
precedence rules for evaluating the expression. The following table
describes the precedence and associativity rules for all the arithmetic
and bitwise operators introduced so far. The table lists operators
from higher to lower precedences, i.e., operators at later rows have
lower precedences than operators at earlier rows.
